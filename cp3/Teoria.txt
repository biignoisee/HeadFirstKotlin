BULLET POINTS
Use functions to organize your code and make it more reusable.
A function can have parameters, so you can pass more than one value to it.
The number and type of values you pass to the function must match the order and type of
the parameters declared by the function.
A function can return a value. You must define the type of value (if any) it returns.
A Unit return type means that the function doesn’t return anything.
Choose for loops over while loops when you know how many times you want to repeat
the loop code.
The readLine() function reads a line of input from the standard input stream. It returns
a String value, the text entered by the user.
If the input stream has been redirected to a file and the end of the file has been reached,
the readLine() function returns null. null means it has no value, or it’s missing.
&& means “and”. || means “or”. ! means “not”
