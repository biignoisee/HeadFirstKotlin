Use fun to define a function.
Every application needs a function named main.
Use // to denote a single-lined comment.
A String is a string of characters. You denote a String value by enclosing its
characters in double quotes.
Code blocks are defined by a pair of curly braces { }.
The assignment operator is one equals sign =.
The equals operator uses two equals signs ==.
Use var to define a variable whose value may change.
Use val to define a value whose value will stay the same.
A while loop runs everything within its block so long as the conditional test is true.
If the conditional test is false, the while loop code block wonâ€™t run, and execution will
move down to the code immediately after the loop block.
Put a conditional test inside parentheses ( ).
Add conditional branches to your code using if and else. The else clause is optional.
You can use if as an expression so that it returns a value. In this case, the else clause is
mandatory.
